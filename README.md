# dgmap-linux
Dungeoneering map overlay for Linux

Launch it from a terminal inside the folder first to see if it runs into any errors

```python
python dgmap.py
```

Once it's set up, make a 'dgmap' shortcut in /usr/bin
```shell
#!/bin/bash
python /path/to/the/script/dgmap/dgmap.py
```
Once launched, drag it to where you want it. Inside the dungeon, press M and the overlay will pick up the map once it opens.
